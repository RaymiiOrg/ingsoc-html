Recently I had to write a few monitoring plugins, one of which was a count of
incoming established connections to a specific network port. In the  past I
would have used `netstat` and a combination of `grep` and `wc` to filter out only
specific ports and established connections, but nowdays `netstat` is replaced by
`ss` on ubuntu. `ss` has options to filter directly on all sorts of stuff, like
state, ports, protocol, making the command I use more readable and use less
pipes.

The below snippet is from one of my webservers. You can check the [manpage][1]
for more information, they have another quite elaborate example:

 	ss -o state fin-wait-1 '( sport = :http or sport = :https )' dst 193.233.7/24
    List all the tcp sockets in state FIN-WAIT-1 for our apache to network 193.233.7/24
    and look at their timers.

### connection filtering with ss

This is the command, it even works for non-root users, which was nice since my monitoring
plugins do not run as root.

	ss --all --numeric --no-header state established  '( sport = :443 )'

Output:

	tcp                    0                           0                                                 128.199.39.10:443                                           178.200.216.97:55467                     
	tcp                    0                           0                                                 128.199.39.10:443                                               137.8.9.12:39760                     
	tcp                    0                           0                                                 128.199.39.10:443                                           213.64.253.119:57065  

To count, just add `wc -l`:

	ss --all --numeric --no-header state established  '( sport = :443 )'| wc -l

Output:

	4

Change the port or add more filters, `'( sport = :443 or sport = :80 )'` (mind
the trailing space after the port number), you should be able to figure it out.

## netstat version

On a system that still has `netstat`, I use the following command:

	netstat -anp | grep :443 | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l
