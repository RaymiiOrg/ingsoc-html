$SUMMARY$

$SPONSORMSG$

This procedure was tested with the AXPbox Alpha emulator and VSI OpenVMS 8.4-1.

### Boot into single user mode


Type following command in boot console to perform a conversational boot:

	P00>>> boot dqa0 -flags 0,1

Replace `dqa0` by your boot device. 

Enter the following commands in the next prompt to boot into single user mode:

	SET/STARTUP OPA0:
	SET WINDOW_SYSTEM 0
	SET WRITESYSPARAMS 0
	CONTINUE

Type following DCL commands to reset the SYSTEM account password:

	SPAWN
	@SYS$SYSTEM:STARTUP
	SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM:
	RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE
	MODIFY SYSTEM /PASSWORD=example
	
Exit out of `UAF` with `CTRL+Z` and reboot the system (`SHUTDOWN` or `REBOOT`) and you should
be able to login with the newly reset password.


### Linux?

On Debian systems you can reset a root password by rebooting, appending
`init=/bin/bash` to the `linux` line of GRUB (bootloader), remounting the disk
as read-write (`mount -o remount,rw`) resetting the password (`passwd`) and
rebooting (`exec /sbin/init 6`).  You need physical access as well and the
OpenVMS procedure is very similar, albeit with different commands.
