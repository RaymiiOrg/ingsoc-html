This week is a little late because my Tiny Tiny RSS feed reader decided to stop working.

If you like this website and want to support it AND get $10 Digital Ocean credit (a VPS 2 months for free), use this link to order: [https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=7435ae6b8212](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=7435ae6b8212) (referral link).

Earlier editions can [be found here](https://raymii.org/s/tags/recap.html). That page has a special RSS feed for the recaps as well.

### News, tutorials and articles

- [Farewell to PrettyTable](http://www.luke.maurits.id.au/blog/post/farewell-to-prettytable.html). A well written story on a long time maintainer and good handover of a project. Prettytable is used all over the OpenStack command line tools, my own Python scripts use it as well. 

- [Parsing 10TB](http://blog.waleson.com/2016/01/parsing-10tb-of-metadata-26m-domains.html) of metadata, 26M domain names and 1.4M SSL certs for $10 on AWS. A tale on using command line tools instead of all the buzzwordy big data solutions. Plain old text files and *NIX tools to get and parse SSL data. 

- [All about Linux Signals](http://www.linuxprogrammingblog.com/all-about-linux-signals?page=show). More on the software development side, but still a good read for a sysadmin to find out what really happens when you brutally murder, ahem, `kill -9` a poor PID.

- A guide on installing and configuring [Let's Encrypt](https://vincent.composieux.fr/article/install-configure-and-automatically-renew-let-s-encrypt-ssl-certificate), including automatic renewal. French guide available as well.

- iPad Pro v.s. Surface Pro 4, an in-depth article on [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/pro-tablet-showdown-ipad-pro-vs-surface-pro-4-1753293972). Conclusion, iPad is for iOS lovers and the Surface Pro is a better work machine. 

- [vim-galore](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore). Not a pornsite, but an interactive guide on Vim. Reminds me of [vim-adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/)

- [Why tools get worse when production moves to China](http://hackaday.com/2016/01/18/whats-in-a-tool-a-case-for-made-in-usa/). Not purposefully, but a small thing here and there, and the amazing tool now is a broken piece of crap.

- A big layoff over at [Makerbot](http://hackaday.com/2015/10/09/makerbot-has-now-cut-36-of-staff-in-last-6-months/). 

- A [book](https://leanpub.com/the-devops-2-toolkit) on Devops. Make sure you hire your devops engineers and buy your devops software. Absolutely don't make any time for better communication between teams.

- Why always [docker](pointlessramblings.com/posts/Why_Always_Docker/). When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail, or, in this case, a container. Docker is very nice in certain use cases, but not if you have to create an init system for your container...

- Make sure you read up on the actual cost of the [cloud service](https://medium.com/@karppinen/how-i-ended-up-paying-150-for-a-single-60gb-download-from-amazon-glacier-6cb77b288c3e) you're using, otherwise a single Amazon Glacier download gets expensive.

- What do you do if your name is in other people's software because your license says they need to do that and random people start harassing you? It happens to the [maintainer of curl](http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/01/19/subject-urgent-warning/).

- An interesting read on [DRI](http://blog.mecheye.net/2016/01/dri/) and the Linux graphics stack. 

- The most [popular](http://www.whatsmypass.com/25-most-popular-passwords-of-2015) password of last year is `123456`. Just like the second most popular, `password`. 

- An iPad-centric whishlist for [iOS 10](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2016/01/how-to-make-the-ipad-more-like-a-mac-without-making-it-less-like-an-ipad/). Apple has two OSes, one for tablets and one for computers, and now they have an iPad in Macbook Air form, and an Macbook in iPad Pro form. THat's not going very well...

- Tinkering on your [NeXT](http://hackaday.com/2016/01/20/lady-ada-turns-next-equipment-into-something-useful/) machine is always fun.

- Unikernel Systems is [bought by Docker Inc](https://blog.docker.com/2016/01/unikernel/). A bunch of Xen developers making very small systems, not much else known.

- Super Mail Forward, an email that [evolves](https://medium.com/@hteumeuleu/super-mail-forward-an-email-that-evolves-as-you-forward-it-84466596f30d) as you forward it. Quite nice to see the different quirks between webmails.

- An article with a good hackernews discussion on the question if [self hosted blogging](http://robertnealan.com/is-self-hosted-blogging-dead/) is dead or not. I quite like my own static site generator, but things like Ghost or Wordpress are nice and shiny as well.

- Posting [SSH logins to Slack](http://sandrinodimattia.net/posting-successful-ssh-logins-to-slack/). I have this but for IRC.

### Software, hardware and releases

- [Interact](http://9to5mac.com/2016/01/13/interact-power-user-contacts-app/), a nice iOS contacts manager. Works great on an iPad. ([via](http://leancrew.com/all-this/))

- OpenBSD is now supported as a [guest os](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20160114113445) on the Xen Hypervisor. Why these days you would use Xen instead of KVM is a miracle to me, but hey, if it works, it's nice.

- [AsteroidOS](http://liliputing.com/2016/01/asteroidos-open-source-smartwatch-operating-system-that-can-replace-android-wear-on-some-watches.html), an open source Watch OS for some android wear devices. Lets hope that it runs longer than a few hours on such a device.

- If you have physical access to [a device](https://firefart.at/post/upc_ubee_fail/), like your ISP modem, you can hack it 99% of the time.

- Cloning [smartcards](http://hackaday.com/2016/01/18/emulating-and-cloning-smart-cards/), even wireless ones. Put your NFC-enabled ID and credit/debit card in a faraday cage...

- Updating the BIOS on a [Dell server](https://major.io/2016/01/18/updating-dell-poweredge-bios-from-linux/). If you have all of Dell's fancy management tools or an iDRAC license you can use those, but this works quite well from Linux.

- A vulnerability in Android < 4.2 and a [guide](http://evilsocket.net/2016/01/18/autopwn-every-android-device-on-your-network-using-bettercap-the-and-addjavascriptinterface-vulnerability/) on exploiting it on your LAN.

- Running [icinga2](http://log.cyconet.org/2016/01/19/trying-icinga2-and-icingaweb2-with-docker/) on Docker. Simple to try, but for a production setup, not so much.

- The first Aplha of [Krita 3.0](https://krita.org/item/first-krita-3-0-pre-alpha/) is out. This "release" includes the latest version of the animation and the instant-preview performance work, plus there are a number of stretch goals from the Kickstarter already available, too. And it is a major upgrade of the core technology that Krita runs on: from Qt4 to Qt5. The latter wasn't something that was a lot of fun, but it's needed to keep Krita code healthy for the future! 

- A small hands-on article about [PiCore](http://www.zdnet.com/article/hands-on-with-picore-7-0-tiny-core-linux-for-the-raspberry-pi/) on the Raspberry Pi. PiCore 0.7 was released last week, a very tiny Linux for your very tiny computer.

- The first beta of [Zabbix 3](http://www.zabbix.com/rn3.0.0beta1.php) is released. More of a Nagios fan myself, I only had problems with crashing and huge databases after a few weeks of Zabbix.

- Audacity [2.1.2 released](http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Release_Notes_2.1.2), with a boatload of new features and bugfixes. I sometimes cut an audio file, but still, very cool software.

- [ctct](https://respiranto.de/bash/) a contact manager for bash, like a smaller abook.


### Talks, videos, slides and podcasts

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZBbgiBU96mM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Using a multimeter, part one of a three part series. ([via](http://lifehacker.com/this-three-part-video-teaches-you-everything-you-need-t-1753456991))

- [20 OSCILLATORS IN 20 MINUTES](https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7549-20_oscillators_in_20_minutes) (from 32C3).

 
### Fun and nifty things and discussions

- [Play FreeCIV online](https://play.freeciv.org/). Amazing what javascript can do.

- From 2010, but a fun read on [three men in a pshych ward thinking they are the same religious leader](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2010/05/jesus_jesus_jesus.html) and what happens when you put them together.

- Old machines, 468's, AT, DX and more old stuff still [being used in production](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/20/486_fleet_still_in_production/). Glad I don't have to support that.

- A funny comin on [men](http://koh.money/men). I'm baffled sometimes by these new TLD's, I mean, `.money` and `.problems`? Nobody ever will type that in...

- Pirating the [Oscars 2016](http://waxy.org/2016/01/pirating_the_oscars_2016/). Everything that's not on Netflix is on your favorite bay-area website.

- Cool looking working SteamPunk Cryptex [USB stick](http://hackaday.com/2016/01/21/steampunk-usb-cryptex-keeps-your-data-secure/). Looks amazing, and it seems to work as well.
