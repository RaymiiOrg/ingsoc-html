One of the servers I use to host email and a few small websites for friend and
family comes with Installatron installed by default. It is a way to easily
install web applications and keep them up to date automatically. 

It is a paid service, but it is free for one domain. It can be confusing for
some users on the server since the button is in the controlpanel.

I decided to remove Installatron from the machine. First remove the plugin from
Directadmin (or other) controlpanel. Then execute the following commands. Remove
the RPM (if CentOS):

    rpm -e installatron-plugin-directadmin 

Remove all the files:

    rm -rf /usr/local/directadmin/plugins/installatron 
    rm -rf /usr/local/installatron 
    rm -rf /var/installatron 
    rm -rf /etc/cron.d/installatron 
    rm -rf /home/*/.installatron

That's it. Installatron has been removed
