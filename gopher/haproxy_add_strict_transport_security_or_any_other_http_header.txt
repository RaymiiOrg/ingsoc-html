This snippet shows you how to add a header to a haproxy response, for example, the HSTS header (http strict transport security).

This snippet was tested on haproxy 1.5.

This snippet is tested on a Digital Ocean VPS. If you like this snippet and want to support me, plus get free credit @ DO, use this link to order a Digital Ocean VPS: [https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=7435ae6b8212](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=7435ae6b8212)   

This for example can be used when haproxy is used for ssl offloading and you want to offer hsts, while the backends not support it.

The following config is required in a `frontend` section:

	frontend example-frontend
	  reqadd X-Forwarded-Proto:\ https
	  rspadd Strict-Transport-Security:\ max-age=31536000;\ includeSubDomains
	  default_backend example-backend

The important part is:

  	rspadd Strict-Transport-Security:\ max-age=31536000;\ includeSubDomains

This adds the header to every response haproxy sends to a client.
