Hi there! I'm Remy, a Linux/UNIX sysadmin; my primary focus is on **building high-available cloud environments in OpenStack, Azure or on premise with Ansible and Terraform** (or any other configuration management tool). My keywords are OpenStack, cloud, virtualization, high-availability, scaling and clustering, security, (Open)SSL, Python, Powershell, Bash and general linux/UNIX system administration. Besides that I also develop [software](https://github.com/raymiiorg/).

I currently work for [VolkerWessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VolkerWessels), the largest Dutch civil engineering construction company as an (Azure) cloud specialist.

I've worked as a sysadmin (in a devops role) for [the Erasmus University Medical Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_MC) (a large hospital and medical university in Rotterdam), [Digidentity](https://www.digidentity.eu/) (a Dutch [certificate authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKIoverheid), the company that develops [DigiD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiD) and other Ruby on Rails applications), [CloudVPS](https://www.cloudvps.com/about-cloudvps) (an OpenStack cloud provider) and a few other smaller companies. I like to design, build, document and manage large, complex and high-available systems. I'm a team player that loves to work with configuration management tools and version control systems. If I do something more than three times, I automate it. **Planning, documentation, monitoring and backups are things I do first, not when the time allows it later.** Last but not least I have an interest in legacy systems like the PDP-11, PDP-8 and operating systems like OpenVMS, HP-UX and old UNIX systems.

This is my personal website, please do note that these articles do not reflect or are based on work, opinions or policies of any of my (previous) employers. Any resemblance to reality is pure coincidence.

This site started in 2006 as my form of (public) documentation. It has grown to include software, tutorials, snippets and articles on linux/UNIX, system administration and everything related with over 10.000 unique visitors a day as of [2018-06](https://raymii.org/s/inc/img/hits-2018.png). The URL is the phonetic way you say my name (Ray-Mii), since non-Dutch speakers always have trouble with the correct pronunciation.
