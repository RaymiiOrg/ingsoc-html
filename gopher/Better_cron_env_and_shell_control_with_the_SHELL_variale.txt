If you don't know what [cron][1] is this post is not for you.

Using the `SHELL` variable in cron is more powerful than you may realize.

## typical crontab

Most people will have this type of setup in their crontab.

    NODE_ENV=production
    OTHER_VAR=foo
    
    */10 * * * * /path/to/node /path/to/my/script.js
    

If you don't want to repeat `/path/to/node` (or your runtime) over and over, you will add a `PATH` variable to go with the other variables.

But what happens if you want to use something like [nvm][2] or [rvm][3] or [virtualenv][4], etc? It is not uncommon to have the above change to something like the following

    */10 * * * * /path/to/my/launcher.sh
    */10 * * * * /path/to/my/launcher_another.sh
    

Now you have several shell scripts which invoke the required commands to setup the environment and then run whatever program.

## enter SHELL

There is a little known special env variable for cron: `SHELL`. Most people know this variable can be used to change the shell your scripts run run (i.e. `SHELL=/bin/bash`), but it can actually run any file!

So lets say I use nvm and want to setup my environment. Instead of making custom launchers for each command, I can simply do the following:

    SHELL=/path/to/setup/cron.bash
    
    */10 * * * * node $HOME/foo.js
    

Now lets look at what `cron.bash` might look like:

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e
     
    source /etc/environment
    source /etc/profile
     
    # setup any env variables you want here
    export NODE_ENV=production
     
    # I use node so I want to add node path stuff via npm
    # $HOME is available, but not many other env vars are by default
    source $HOME/nvm/nvm.sh
     
    # restore SHELL env var for cron
    SHELL=/bin/bash
    # execute the cron command in an actual shell
    exec /bin/bash --norc "$@"

For the most part it looks just like any other shell script. The important magical parts are the last 4 lines. These lines put back the SHELL variable to `/bin/bash` and then execute a bash shell to run the cronline command (the stuff for the specific cronjob).

    SHELL=/full/path/to/cron.bash
    MAILTO=cron@example.com
     
    # For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
    #
    # m h  dom mon dow   command
     
    # dummy cron command to print the environment variables ever minute
    * * * * * env
     
    # node scripts can simply be run using `node` now
    * * * * * node /path/to/script/.js

Now our cron files have a consistent environment setup and we can simply run whatever commands we need without further PATH tricks or nonsense.

Go forth and update your dirty crontabs!
