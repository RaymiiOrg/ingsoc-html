This tutorial shows you how to have NGINX use different folders as different upstream proxy's.

By default, if you have a `location` block which has a proxy pass, and the `location` block is a folder, for example `/wiki`, the folder is sent back to the proxied server:

    location /nagios/ {
        proxy_pass  http://10.0.21.8:80/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        proxy_redirect    off;
    }

The above block will, when browsed, sent you to `http://10.0.21.8/nagios/`, because that is the nginx location. However, if you want it to go to `http://10.0.21.8/` you either have to rewrite or use the `/` location.

The below example has the correct rewrite rule:


    location /nagios/ {
        rewrite ^/nagios(/.*)$ $1 break;
        proxy_pass  http://10.0.21.8:80/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        proxy_redirect    off;
    }

As you can see, this line:

    rewrite ^/collectd(/.*)$ $1 break;

fixes the above problem, and sends you to `http://10.0.21.8/` instead of `http://10.0.21.8/nagios`.
