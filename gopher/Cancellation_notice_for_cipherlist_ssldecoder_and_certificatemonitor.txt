### Cancellation

This is a short notice that the public services I was providing, 
[cipherli.st][1], [ssldecoder.org][2] and [certificatemonitor.org][3] are
suspended and cancelled as of now. The source code is still available via [my
github][4], but the domains and hosting are stopped. If you want to use these
services, you now must host them yourself.


Any information on these websites, tests or services provides by those websites
is now no longer from me, related to me or endorsed by me. The domains have
been cancelled and will be available for registration again when the cool
down period expires.
