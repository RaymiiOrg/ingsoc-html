This is an overview of small operating systems and Linux distributions, most of them work well on older hardware (pre-dual core era). It provides screenshots, package information, size and specs and project information on the distro. I've used all of them myself, except Sky OS. Not all of them are Linux, I also cover some more exotic operating systems, I like those. But, they have to have a GUI interface and software to accomplish task with. ([Sorry MikeOS](http://mikeos.berlios.de)). The list constist of: Feather Linux, MenuetOS, Sky OS, Damn Small Linux, Tiny Core, SliTaz GNU/Linux, ReactOS, Haiku, Syllable, AntiX, Puppy and EcomStation2.
