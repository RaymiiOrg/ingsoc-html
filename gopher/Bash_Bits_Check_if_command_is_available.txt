Bash Bits are small examples and tips for Bash Scripts. 
This bash bit shows you how to check if a piece of software is installed on 
a machine. It's a function you can use in your shell scripts.

### command_exists()

The function uses the [command][1] binary to check if a binary is available.
`command` handles all the magic of searching your path, checking if something
is executable, all the dificult stuff that could also be different on other
distributions. 

This is the function:

    command_exists() {
        # check if command exists and fail otherwise
        command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
        if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
            echo "I require $1 but it's not installed. Abort."
            exit 1
        fi
    }

You can use it in a loop to check multiple binaries:

    for COMMAND in "awk" "sed" "grep" "tar" "gzip" "which" "openssl" "curl"; do
        command_exists "${COMMAND}"
    done

If a command does not exist, your script will fail and exit with an error
message:

    I require curl but it's not installed. Abort.
