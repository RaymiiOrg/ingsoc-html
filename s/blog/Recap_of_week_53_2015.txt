### News, tutorials and articles

- [Dan Lynch](http://danlynch.org/blog/2015/12/got-a-date/) of Linux Outlaws (and OggCamp and many other podcasts) fame, has a form of cancer. Send him a positive message to show some support!
- Time for some [good news](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/12/24/good-news-part-1/). Yay nice things! The daily news should include a "Good News" segment every day.
- Let's Encrypt hits 200K certificates and is the [5'th largest CA for non-expired Domain Validation Certificates](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/3yrato/lets_encrypt_issued_over_200k_certificates_and/). Did I mention already that I find Let's Encrypt AMAZING?
- Set up your PGP keys in a hardware secure device, the [Yubikey Neo (and Neo-N)](https://trmm.net/Yubikey) support the OpenPGP Card protocol. Mini HSM in your pocket. Put one in your vault and use it as your master GPG signing key.
- Outlook, since 2003, is "vulnerable" to [OLE attackts](https://medium.com/@networksecurity/oleoutlook-bypass-almost-every-corporate-security-control-with-a-point-n-click-gui-37f4cbc107d0#.s7estyw9m). Send an EXE as an object in an attached message and it'll be executed without warnings. Mailfilters don't seem to scan for this.
- End to end deployment with [Azure](http://sysadvent.blogspot.nl/2015/12/day-4-end-to-end-deployment-with.html)
- 93,112 hits in one day with Wordpress? Sure, it's possible, after some [optimization](https://donmelton.com/2015/12/26/the-move-to-wordpress-and-the-traffic-that-followed/) 
- Why some sysadmins are [scared of DevOps](http://sysadvent.blogspot.nl/2015/12/day-15-fear-and-loathing-in-systems.html)
- Turn the Raspberry Pi zero into a [USB serial or ethernet device](https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget?view=all)
- [Am I hacked or is it just vodafone?](http://www.sphaero.org/blog:2012:0418_am_i_hacked_oh_it_s_just_vodafone). Stupid providers trying to "optimize" your "experience", while actually just MITM'ing the connection when you use a browser. 
- [As a reaction on the above article, Do Tor exit nodes alter your content?](https://www.vanimpe.eu/2015/12/29/do-tor-exit-no-than-vodafone/) Conclusion, use a VPN via Tor (or your cell conection) or make sure you use HTTPS websites.
- You aren't allowed to join [Troy Hunt's](http://www.troyhunt.com/2015/12/no-you-cant-join-my-wifi-network.html) Wifi network. /me has a guest VLAN and guest wifi AP at home with QoS port filtering and a seperate IP (yay XS4ALL for a /29 on a home DSL). That guest Wifi has the same name as the national public transport wifi, so everyone always connects. 
- The Debian creator, Ian Murdock, [passed away](https://bits.debian.org/2015/12/mourning-ian-murdock.html).
- A colleague of mine has a lot of Thin Clients, and writes about them. He recently got a [HP t5730 and a GPU expansion module](http://www.arm-blog.com/hp-t5730-expansion-module/)
- [Will you plz instll exe on all your devices and I give u monetz](https://twitter.com/Raspberry_Pi/status/679640660044058624). The Raspberry Pi foundation also gets spammed, but placing an EXE on a linux PC? Those spammers should do their research better. 
- Set up country based blocking with [pfSense](http://www.derman.com/blogs/Setting-Up-Country-Blocking). On Linux, the [CSF](http://configserver.com/cp/csf.html) wrapper makes this also very easy to do. Block China and Eastern Europe and your abuse drops by 80%.
- The free AVG antivirus installs a browser extension which, according to Google, is full of bugs and [completely broken](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/12/29/avg_google_chrome_extension/). Tell us something new, all those "tuneup" and "optimizers" and "registry cleaners" are bullcrap.
- Linode has a few-day long [DDoS attack](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/12/29/day_four_of_linode_data_center_attacks/).
- [Take notes](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/TakeAndKeepNotes) when (and as) you do things and keep them. I can only agree. Most of my site is my own documentation, but publicly available.
- A review of a mini PC, including cracking up the case of the [Geekbox Mini PC](http://liliputing.com/2015/12/geekbox.html).
- North Korea's Red Star OS (linux) snoops, spies and watermarks on everything [the users do](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/27/north-koreas-computer-operating-system-revealed-by-researchers).
- Linux Mint Montly overview for december, talking about [Linux Mint 18](http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2969).
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/news/2015/12/31/2015-report/) and GEGL in 2015.
- Next [Android](http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/29/google-confirms-next-android-version-wont-use-oracles-proprietary-java-apis) will switch from Oracle Java to OpenJDK. For legal reasons...
- I had an issue with [dependency removal on debian](https://raymii.org/s/software/Recursively_find_all_installed_package_dependencies.html).

### Software and releases

- UNIX on the [Game Boy Advance](http://www.kernelthread.com/publications/gbaunix/). Amazing. It runs UNIXv5 via a PDP-11 emulator (SIMH) for ARM on a GBA. How cool is that?
- Also, Linux on the Nintentdo [3DS](http://hackinformer.com/2015/12/29/linux-on-the-3ds/). Not much works, but still very cool.
- [Solus 1.0](https://solus-project.com/2015/12/27/solus-1-0-released/) released. Linux distro based on nothing, with its own GTK3 desktop environment, Budgie.
- Apt updates will be [faster in the future](https://juliank.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/much-faster-incremental-apt-updates/), APT 1.1.6, updating with PDiffs enabled took 41 seconds, on APT 1.1.7, updating with PDiffs enabled took 4 seconds.
- Someone [leaked the AmigaOS 3.1 (or 4)](http://commodore.ninja/amiga-os-kickstart-and-workbench-source-coded-leaked/) sourcecode. And what the fuck is with those new TLD's? This is a .ninja... Poor Bind...
- Linux Mint 17.3 Rosa beta released for the [KDE version](http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2963) and the [XFCE version](http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2962). Before Arch, I was a fulltime user of Linux Mint, and I still recommend it to others who want to try Linux. It's very good.
- ReText 5.3 [released](https://mitya57.me/weblog/2015/12/retext-53-released.html). It's a Markdown and ReST editor, I use it often to preview my articles.
- An open source hardware and software [router kickstarter](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/turris-omnia-hi-performance-open-source-router#/). Beware, because we've seen many kickstarters like these, not living up to the promises. 
- It seems [Perl 6](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/25/christmas-is-here/) is released.
- People showed a demo of Linux running on the [PS4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A7V3GLWF6U). No idea how real it is.

### Talks, videos, slides and podcasts

Let's Encrypt -- What launching a free CA looks like, by Roland Bracewell Shoemaker

- The [32C3: gated communities](https://media.ccc.de/c/32c3) video's are all up here. Expect a few highlights in the next coming weeks. ([Youtube channel here](https://www.youtube.com/user/CCCen/videos))
- German talk on [smartcards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERyMVIBdzXM)
- [Linux Unplugged 125](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/92101/slaving-for-red-star-os-lup-125/) covering SolusOS 1.0, and Red Star OS, the north korean spy-distro.
 
### Fun and nifty things and discussions

- We all hate [Network Solutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3ynwpw/fuck_you_network_solutions/).
- A story about running [BSD on a PIC32MX MIPS microcontroller](http://blog.imgtec.com/mips-processors/can-it-run-bsd-the-story-of-a-mips-based-pic32-microcontroller). It's not a toaster and it's not NetBSD, but it is RetroBSD, a 16-bit 2.11BSD port. The microcontroller has 128 KB of RAM. Cool.
- Spell correctly on your [resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3yfjvh/spell_things_correctly_on_your_resume/) and letters. When I need to hire people I reject the ones with the obvious spelling errors right away.
- How many GNU/Linux users are [needed to change a lightbulb](https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/users-lightbulb.html)?
- Linux [Joke Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/3ydi3t/linux_joke_thread/).
- It was [Linus Torvalds'](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/3yjrv6/happy_birthday_linus_torvalds/) birthday.
- Leading [change in organizations](http://sysadvent.blogspot.nl/2015/12/day-9-leading-change-in-organizations.html). hard, but when it works, it's very rewarding.
- Something else that is hard, sometimes literaly, is Pooping on [vacation](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/12/all-i-got-for-christmas-was-constipation/422046/).
- [Laser Cut Map](http://hackaday.com/2015/12/29/laser-cut-map-taken-to-the-next-level/) taken to the next level. A beautifull creation of a Portland map. [Image gallery here](https://imgur.com/gallery/vuyDa) and mini-guide [here](http://hackaday.com/2015/11/23/laser-cutting-bathymetric-maps/)
- [Lockpicking is fun](http://lifehacker.com/learning-to-pick-locks-taught-me-how-crappy-door-locks-1750091711).
- A real [hoverboard](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/12/29/working_hoverboard_wtf/). Big foam plate with much fans? At least it's better than those two-weeled steerless skateboards that people call hoverboards.
- A 120 node [Raspberry Pi Cluster](http://techweek.xyz/what-would-you-do-with-a-120-raspberry-pi-cluster/). Cool, but what would you use it for? Bitcoin mining?
