You might have heard of the Raspberry Pi, or the Cotton Candy, or the Snowball. Those are, besides nice pi, candy and snow, also small Linux pc's. Most of them have an ARM chip, a small amount of memory and run some for of Linux.  

This page will provide an overview of what is on the market, specs, an image, and links to the boards. It is probably not complete, and if I forgot one, please leave a comment. I think I'll be doing another overview at the end of the year.  
Prices are in US dollar unless otherwise stated. It is the starting price for the cheapest model where applicable.  
USB is always 2.0 unless otherwise stated.  
If specs are known, I add them, (HMDI 1.4, 10/100/1000 base T ethernet), if not then it is like (HDMI, RJ-45 ethernet).
