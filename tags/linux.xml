                <title>Personal Wireguard VPN on a Freedombox with Debian</title>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Wireguard_VPN_on_Freedombox.html</guid>
                <description>This guide will show you how to set up a personal Wireguard VPN server on Debian or Ubuntu with Freedombox. Freedombox will be used to manage the VPN software, firewall and users. Wireguard is a relatively new VPN built in to the linux kernel. Freedombox is a long running project under the Debian umbrella providing a private server for non experts with focus on user freedom, ease of use and privacy. Combined, those two make a great pair. In the past I've written many articles on how to setup your own personal VPN server, but those all required manual setup and maintenance. With freedombox, the updates are automatic and the management is hidden away behind a convenient web interface. </description>

                <title>Installing Freedombox on Armbian on the Olimex Pioneer</title>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Installing_Freedombox_On_Armbian_On_The_Olimex_A20_Pioneer.html</guid>
                <description>FreedomBox is a private server for non-experts: it lets you install and configure server applications with only a few clicks. It runs on cheap hardware of your choice, uses your internet connection and power, and is under your control. Last year the Pioneer became available, officially supported and sanctioned by the Freedombox Foundation. This is a home server you can buy from Olimex, comes in a nice metal case with a proper power supply, network cable, battery and SD card preloaded with Freedombox. Plug in and go. Perfect for users that don't want to tinker but do want their freedom and control. With the Pioneer, both the hardware and software are fully open source. In the default provided distribution for the Pioneer there are a few things I dislike. This guide covers the installation of Freedombox and Debian for the Olimex A20 Lime2 Pioneer with Armbian including reinstalling, Apache SSL certificate and LDAP issues.</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Run_CLion_on_Android.html</guid>
                <description>How often do you read articles that state that people have replaced their main computer with an iPad and are fully content? Now, how many of those articles just use a linux server (vps) somewhere with some native apps, but mostly SSH to that server? Well, what if I told you that you can run a full blown IDE, the best IDE for C++ there is, CLion by JetBrains, on Android? Including compiling, just native GCC, CMake, GDB and all the stuff you are used to? Just for fun I've installed CLion on an old Samsung Tab S2 I had lying around, using Ubuntu in a chroot. It works way better than I'd expected, with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse it's almost as if your on a desktop. I wonder if you could run Android Studio and use the tablet to compile app's for itself. This article shows some photo's, including a mechanical keyboard, different window managers and had instructions to replicate this setup.</description>

                <description>A post on lobste.rs on the C feature trigraphs triggered me to write this piece on the C++ feature, alternative tokens. I've recently suprised a co- worker by using an if statement with 'or' instead of '||', which works fine, but he never saw it before. It's in C++ since C++ 11, but MSVC requires a specific compiler flag ('/Za') or the 'iso646.h' header. This post has a few samples on the usage inclusing other alternative tokens like bitor, xor and or_eq.</description>

                <description>This guide will show you how to setup a new C++ project with CMake and unit tests via Google's test framework. With this setup you can get started right away with test-driven-development in C++. It is also simple enough to look and figure out how to add gtest to your existing project and start doing TDD on your legacy (existing) codebase.</description>

                <description>Recently I was debugging connection issues with a system that uses connman as it's network management software. In the log it was visible that the connection went away and came back, logged with 'operstate' $number $state. I couldn't easily find an overview of all the possible states, but since it's open source we can take a look at the code to find out. Publishing it here for future reference.</description>

                <title>C++ template definitions in a .cpp file (instead of a header file)</title>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/snippets/Cpp_template_definitions_in_a_cpp_file_instead_of_header.html</guid>
                <description>In this snippet I'll show you how to place your C++ template definitions in a seperate .cpp file. I'd recommend you to just put template definitions in your header file, or a .hpp file, but if you really want to there is a trick to get them in a seperate .cpp file. The trick is to explicitly instanciate every template you're going to use at the end of the .cpp file. With many different templates and types this becomes cumbersome, but for certain usecases it could be useful. </description>

                <description>In this snippet I'll show you a variadic template to write to a file. In line with my other experiments to get a better grasp at templates, this example improves on my earlier attempt by using a variadic template, thus allowing you to provide an infinite number of columns to the csv file of any type that has the overloaded &lt;&lt; operator.</description>

                <description>In this quick snippet I'll show you how to create and write to a csv file. It includes checking if the file is writable, and if it's not there, creates it with a different first row as header. It's a quick example, I've used it to log some test data. It can probably be improved.</description>

                <title>Cooking with C++ templates and stronger types</title>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Cooking_with_Cpp_templates_and_stronger_types.html</guid>
                <description>To gain a better understanding of C++ templates I'm playing around with them. Most of the online guides stop at the example of a simple template to, for example, get the max of two inputs, or cover just a bit more (like how to overload operators for your specific template classes to make &lt;&lt; and + / - work). Combining templates with a stronger type to pass stuff around led me to a test kitchen. As in, some code with ingredients, amounts and an oven. One small thing kept it from working, after some feedback it turned out I was passing the wrong parameters to the template. Afterwards the error also made sense. This post covers both my learning and a small piece on stronger types.</description>

                <description>In this article I'll show you how to use a variadic template in C++. Variadic templates allow you to have a template with a variable number of arguments, also called a parameter pack. Unpacking that pack is more difficult than it should be, so we use a recursive template to iterate over all the parameters one by one. I've also included an example in Python to compare to.</description>

                <description>This article covers the basic installation and configuration of Arch Linux, the distro that adheres to the Keep It Simple, Stupid principle. Arch Linux is a rolling release, that means that you always have the latest and greatest software. With Arch, you're on your own. In a world where where technology is taking your personal responsibility and giving it to the cloud, or to an internet search filter or the device manufacturers, getting your hands dirty with an operating system can be a revelation. Not only will you learn a great deal about how Linux works and what holds the whole thing together, you'll get a system you understand from the inside-out, and one that can be instantly upgraded to all the latest packages. You may also learn something about yourself in the process. And despite its reputation, it's not that difficult.</description>

                <description>One of my Raspberry Pi's was running a test setup of the Citadel groupware service. The test was sucessfull, so I set up a real world setup. The Raspberry Pi would serve another purpose, namely, a Linux Torrent seedbox. As in, to seed Linux torrents from linuxtracker.org. I choose Transmission for this, because it is simple, fast and stable. Transmission has a good webinterface, plus it allows access from remote clients with the transmission-remote gui packages. This article shows you how to set it up on a Raspberry Pi running Arch Linux.</description>
