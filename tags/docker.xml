                <title>Semi-accurate live stream viewer count (hls/rtmp/restreamer) on the command line</title>

                <description>Due to all the working-from-home in the past few months I had to setup a live stream. At first the stream went directly to YouTube, but after they've screwed up multiple times, we decided to not be dependent on them. Using restreamer, a piece of open source software to live stream both to your own server and to another (YouTube) at the same time, we have more control over the stream and are not surprised by YouTube doing stupid stuff unannounced. Restreamer provides a simple web player that works on all major platforms and streams to YouTube, but one thing it lacks is a live viewer count. That's a hard problem to solve correctly and accurately, in this article I'll show you how to do it semi-accurately via multiple ways, including live graphs. This article contains a rant on YouTube breaking stuff and the commands used to get a live viewer count. </description>

                <title>Running gnash on Ubuntu 20.04 (in Docker with X11 forwarding)</title>

                <description>As you might have noticed, I'm slowly updating servers and workstations to Ubuntu 20.04, and as always with major upgrades, things break or are removed. Earlier this week I fixed up pygopherd and today I'll get gnash running again. Gnash is not updated since 2011 and therefore, finally, removed from the Ubuntu 20.04 repositories. Compiling it from source proved to be a lot of effort due to gstreamer dependencies and after a few hours I thought, why not just spin up a Ubuntu 18.04 Docker container, install gnash and forward X11. That took just about 10 minutes and now I'm happily running gnash again. In this tutorial I'll show you how to setup gnash in a docker container with x11 forwarding and host networking.</description>

                <description>At work and at home my ISP's have native IPv6. I recently was at a clients location where they had no IPv6 at all and had to set up and demonstrate an application in a Docker container with IPv6 functionality. They said the had IPv6 but on location it appeared that IPv6 wasn't working. Since IPv6 was required for the demo the container needed a workaround. This article describes the workaround I used to add IPv6 to a Docker container on a non IPv6 network.</description>
