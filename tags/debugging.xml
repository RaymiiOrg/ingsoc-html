                <description>In QT you can use a few functions from the `qDebug.h` header like `qDebug()` and `qWarning()` to log information to the console. In QML you can use the likes of `console.log()`, `console.error()`. It's also very easy to implement your own logger (eg. `SyslogMessageHandler`) if you want something different, like logging to syslog and the console.
In this post I'll show you how to disable both forms of logging in a release build, qml and qt have different ways to manage their output.</description>
