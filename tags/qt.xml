                <title>Disable (debug) logging in QT and QML</title>

                <description>In QT you can use a few functions from the `qDebug.h` header like `qDebug()` and `qWarning()` to log information to the console. In QML you can use the likes of `console.log()`, `console.error()`. It's also very easy to implement your own logger (eg. `SyslogMessageHandler`) if you want something different, like logging to syslog and the console.
In this post I'll show you how to disable both forms of logging in a release build, qml and qt have different ways to manage their output.</description>

                <title>QT / QML Signals and Slots with C++</title>

                <description>QT has an Observer mechanism built in, which they call '[Signals and Slots](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210180603/https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots.html)'. It allows objects to communicate with each other without having to have knowledge of either ones internals. By inheriting from `QObject` and defining a few `Q_PROPERTY` macro's, the QT Meta Object Compiler (`moc`) does all the hard work for you.
Inside a C++ class this all works handy dandy and is reasonable easy to follow, but when using QML it requires a bit more work. This small example shows you how to bind QML and C++ together using signals and slots, in QT 5.12.</description>
