                <description>This site is generated with my self-written open source static site generator named ingsoc (named after 1984). I've updated the layout of the website to be less cluttered, allowing you to get to the content much faster. Inspired by my recent gopher adventures I decided to do away with the 2 column layout (drop the sidebar with menu) and have a smaller header with essential links. On mobile this makes a huge difference in scrolling, on the desktop it looks less cluttered. This article details all the changes with side by side images showing differences.</description>

                <title>Convert markdown inline links to reference style links with Pandoc</title>

                <description>Markdown has two options to create a link. A link is the piece of text you click to go to another webpage. Actually, three ways, since you can just embed HTML code in Markdown. I write all the content for this site in Markdown files, which are then converted by my static site generator to HTML, text and a gopher version. I'm used to using the inline link style, which is  where you paste the link right in the text. Since I've enabled the Gopher  version of raymii.org, I noticed that there was no line wrapping. The HTML  website all arranges that via CSS, but the text-only Gopher does not. Sometimes  Gopher clients wrap text, but most don't. I'm re-wrapping all articles to make them fit, but the wrapping is way off with inline style markdown links. By  converting them to reference style markdown links, the wrapping looks way better, and as an added bonus, reference style links give a better overview. There are a few scripts floating around to convert these links, but either  Ruby or NodeJS. It turns out after a bit of research that Pandoc, the anything-to-anything text conversion tool, has an option to use reference style links. With this option, I converted all the articles here (almost 400) to the reference style Markdown links.</description>

                <description>I've made some new improvements to this website, you can now view raymii.org on Gopher! Building on the last site improvement, every article being available as plain text, it was easy to generate a gophermap file and bind it all together with pygopherd.</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Site_Improvements_for_accessibility.html</guid>
                <description>I've made some new improvements to this website. Raymii.org is generated using my self-written static site generator named ingsoc, the new features are focussed on accessibility. If you are using a screen reader or command-line browser this will benefit you. Or if you like to archive stuff offline. The two main improvements are a text-only version of every content page (article/tutorial etc) and a 'Skip to main content' link.</description>

                <description>This site is generated with my self-written open source static site generator named ingsoc (named after 1984). I've updated the overview pages with a new layout so that items are sorted by their publishing date instead of alphabetically. I've also rewritten some internal logic regarding tags and categories. This article shows the difference before and after and includes some old screenshots of raymii.org.</description>

                <title>ingsoc</title>

                <description>ingsoc is a static site generator written in Python with the purpose of generating raymii.org. It differs from other static site generators because it does not create a blog-like site, but it is focused on pages and structure. It also does not use a template engine. It generates categories, pages, tags, an XML sitemap and a RSS feed. It takes markdown files with a yaml config header as input, and outputs html.</description>
