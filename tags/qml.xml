                <title>QT / QML Signals and Slots with C++</title>

                <description>QT has an Observer mechanism built in, which they call '[Signals and Slots](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210180603/https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots.html)'. It allows objects to communicate with each other without having to have knowledge of either ones internals. By inheriting from `QObject` and defining a few `Q_PROPERTY` macro's, the QT Meta Object Compiler (`moc`) does all the hard work for you.
Inside a C++ class this all works handy dandy and is reasonable easy to follow, but when using QML it requires a bit more work. This small example shows you how to bind QML and C++ together using signals and slots, in QT 5.12.</description>
