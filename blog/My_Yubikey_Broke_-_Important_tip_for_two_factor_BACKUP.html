<p>Today my trusty old first generation Yubikey didn&#39;t light up when I plugged it
in. No problem for me, I had a backup key. But most people don&#39;t, so here&#39;s an
important tip when you use two factor authentication like a Yubikey, Nitrokey or
Google Authenticator (HOTP). TL;DR: Have a second hardware token stored away
safely and backup your QR codes (print/screenshot) somewhere secure. Swap the
hardware tokens often to make sure they both work with all services. Today my

<p>As we all know, 2 factor authentication is important. Passwords are insecure,
can be brute forced or logged (malware, keylogger) and are re-used everywhere.
If you&#39;re password is leaked, when you are using two factor, something you know
(password/username) and something you have (security token, time-based code),
the attacker doesn&#39;t have access to your stuff unless they also compromise the
second factor.</p>

<p>I love security devices, I&#39;ve written <a href="https://raymii.org/s/articles/Get_Started_With_The_Nitrokey_HSM.html">a lot</a> about the open source
<a href="https://raymii.org/s/articles/Nitrokey_Start_Getting_started_guide.html">NitroKey</a> devices, <a href="https://raymii.org/s/articles/Decrypt_NitroKey_HSM_or_SmartCard-HSM_private_keys.html">even how to get the private key fronm the HSM</a>. Also,
the <a href="https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/FST-01_firmware_upgrade_via_usb.html">FST-01</a>, an open source GnuPG token and the <a href="https://raymii.org/s/articles/Nitrokey_HSM_in_Apache_with_mod_nss.html">SmartCard-HSM</a>. In my
professional job I work with enterprise HSM devices (Safenet, Gemalto).</p>

<h3>Backups backups backups!</h3>

<p>This tip applies both to HOTP tokens (Google Authenticator) and hardware tokens.</p>

<h4>HOTP / TOTP</h4>

<p>If you use Google Authenticator (or any other TOTP/HOTP), you get a QR code to
scan with your device or a code to enter. Screenshot that code and print it,
file it in a folder. Or write down the code.</p>

<p><img src="https://raymii.org/s/inc/img/google_auth.png" alt="TOTP"></p>

<p>I myself have a second Android device at home with all the codes scanned as
well, so when my main phone breaks I have an &#39;online&#39; backup. Since the codes
are all printed, when my main phone is working again, I scan the codes from the
&#39;offline&#39; backup to add them back. I don&#39;t have to login to every service or
contact customer support to change the 2 factor settings.</p>

<h4>Hardware tokens</h4>

<p><img src="https://raymii.org/s/inc/img/yubikeys.png" alt="yubikeys"></p>

<p>The physical tokens, like the Yubikey, GnuPG (FST-01 or Nitrokey Start/Pro),
SmartCard HSM, Nitrokey HSM or the RSA token, yes my keychain is full with those
sadly, all have a second device. At home I have a &#39;backup&#39; keychain with
authentication tokens. Which means, a second Yubikey (for KeePass), a second
Nitrokey Pro (for GPG) and a second Nitrokey HSM (S/MIME and other
certificates). It also has copies of the important physical keys (car, home,
etc).</p>

<p>This keychain is stored in a safe next to the phone with the authenticator and
the printed QR codes. Also a printout of my private keys which are not in
hardware tokens (with passwords).</p>

<p>You must also add all these devices to the services you use. Lastpass for
example supports up to 5 yubikeys. It&#39;s not much use to have a second YubiKey if
you can&#39;t use it. So make sure to add the token to the service you use.</p>

<p>In the case of the GPG token and the HSM, backup the key material on them and
import it on the second device.</p>

<p>The last step in this backup scheme is, as is with all backups, to regularly
test them. Otherwise a backup is worth nothing. I swap the keychain once every
month, so I know it works with all the services it needs to. If something
doesn&#39;t work, I don&#39;t want to find out on a critical moment, rather as soon as
possible. Just as with all other backups, do a restore test once in a while.</p>

<p>I know that this increases the cost, instead of 1 token you need to buy two, and
Yubikeys are pricey ($50 as of today). But I had my two Yubikeys since around
2010, so 8 years, that is a cost I could spread out. The other hardware tokens
are either bought via my work (free for me yay) or paid for myself. But, my time
is costly, so I rather buy two tokens than to spend an afternoon fixing all the
2 factor authentication.</p>
