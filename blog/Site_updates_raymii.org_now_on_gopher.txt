I've made some new improvements to this website. Raymii.org is generated using my self-written static site generator named ingsoc and it now supports Gopher. You can browse to [gopher://raymii.org:70](gopher://raymii.org:70/) using your favorite gopher browser (`lynx`) to view all the articles here on gopherspace. If you don't have a gopher browser, you can use [the floodgap http to gopher proxy](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?a=gopher%3A%2F%2Fraymii.org%3A70%2F)

If you want to know what Gopher is, [read this article](http://web.archive.org/web/20190310082022/https://prgmr.com/blog/gopher/2018/08/23/gopher.html). The reason for me to add Gopher support for my site is just that I like tinkering and text-based simple stuff. Gopher fits that bill.

Due to [this excellent guide](https://prgmr.com/blog/gopher/2018/11/09/setting-up-gopherserver.html) on `pygopherd` and how to create a `Gophermap` (sort of `index.html` file) I was able to get up and running quickly. I made an Ansible playbook to install and configure `Pygopherd` and updated my static site generator to [generate the gophermap](https://github.com/RaymiiOrg/raymiiorg.github.io/tree/master/gopher)

Images and links are not handled yet. You basically get the Markdown I write on which this site is generated. Just as the plain text file link you can click at every article.

If you use the gopher version of Raymii.org, [please let me know](https://raymii.org/s/static/About.html). 

[Last year I did some site updates focussed on accessibility](https://raymii.org/s/blog/Site_Improvements_for_accessibility.html).
