           <h2>About</h2> <p>Hi there! I'm Remy, a Linux/UNIX sysadmin; my primary focus is on <b>building high-available cloud environments in OpenStack, Azure or on premise with Ansible and Terraform</b> (or any other configuration management tool). My keywords are OpenStack, cloud, virtualization, high-availability, scaling and clustering, security, (Open)SSL, Python, Powershell, Bash and general linux/UNIX system administration. Besides that I also develop <a href="https://github.com/raymiiorg/">software</a>.</p><p>I currently work for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VolkerWessels">VolkerWessels</a>, the largest Dutch civil engineering construction company as an (Azure) cloud specialist. </p><p>I've worked as a sysadmin (in a devops role) for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_MC">the Erasmus University Medical Center</a> (a large hospital and medical university in Rotterdam), <a href="https://www.digidentity.eu/">Digidentity</a> (a Dutch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKIoverheid">certificate authority</a>, the company that develops <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiD">DigiD</a> and other Ruby on Rails applications), <a href="https://www.cloudvps.com/about-cloudvps"</a>CloudVPS</a> (an OpenStack cloud provider) and a few other smaller companies. I like to design, build, document and manage large, complex and high-available systems. I'm a team player that loves to work with configuration management tools and version control systems. If I do something more than three times, I automate it. <b>Planning, documentation, monitoring and backups are things I do first, not when the time allows it later.</b> Last but not least I have an interest in legacy systems like the PDP-11, PDP-8 and operating systems like OpenVMS, HP-UX and old UNIX systems.</p><p>To get in touch, <a href="https://raymii.org/s/static/About.html">click here</a>.<br><br>This is my personal website, please do note that these articles do not reflect or are based on work, opinions or policies of any of my (previous) employers. Any resemblance to reality is pure coincidence.</p><p>This site started in 2006 as my form of (public) documentation. It has grown to include software, tutorials, snippets and articles on linux/UNIX, system administration and everything related with over 10.000 unique visitors a day as of <a href="https://raymii.org/s/inc/img/hits-2018.png">2018-06</a>.

With OpenSSL 1.1.1 you can use TLSv1.3. This guide covers the installation of OpenSSL 1.1.1 on Ubuntu, testing the connection to a server  and specific ciphersuites.

This script downloads an URL, parses it with readability and returns the plaintext (as markdown). It supports RSS feeds (will convert every article in the feed) and saves every article. My usecase is twofold. One is to convert RSS feeds to a gopher site, the second is to get full text in my RSS reader. The script contains a few workarounds for so-called cookiewalls. It also pauses between RSS feed articles to not do excessive requests. The readability part is handled by Python, no external services are used.</p><a href="software/totext.py-Convert_URL_or_RSS_feed_to_plaintext_with_readability.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Convert_markdown_inline_links_to_reference_style_links_with_Pandoc.html">Convert markdown inline links to reference style links with Pandoc</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">10-04-2019 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>Markdown has two options to create a link. A link is the piece of text you click to go to another webpage. Actually, three ways, since you can just embed HTML code in Markdown. I write all the content for this site in Markdown files, which are then converted by my static site generator to HTML, text and a gopher version. I'm used to using the inline link style, which is  where you paste the link right in the text. Since I've enabled the Gopher  version of raymii.org, I noticed that there was no line wrapping. The HTML  website all arranges that via CSS, but the text-only Gopher does not. Sometimes  Gopher clients wrap text, but most don't. I'm re-wrapping all articles to make them fit, but the wrapping is way off with inline style markdown links. By  converting them to reference style markdown links, the wrapping looks way better, and as an added bonus, reference style links give a better overview. There are a few scripts floating around to convert these links, but either  Ruby or NodeJS. It turns out after a bit of research that Pandoc, the anything-to-anything text conversion tool, has an option to use reference style links. With this option, I converted all the articles here (almost 400) to the reference style Markdown links.</p><a href="articles/Convert_markdown_inline_links_to_reference_style_links_with_Pandoc.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="software/Sparkling_Network.html">Sparkling Network</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">Published: 12-01-2019 | Last update: 07-04-2019 | Author: Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>This is an overview of all the servers in the Sparkling Network, mostly as an overview for myself, but it might be interesting for others.

The opkg command installs these packages and OpenEmbedded comes with a set of tools to build .ipk packages. Recently I had to create ipk packages in a scripted fashion for a few hundred systems, all unique per system. The .ipk packages includes a few software changes for debugging, a systemd service and one precompiled binary. The yocto build tools were not available on the machine where these packages would be made so I had to figure out how to make them by hand, which means, automatically. The packages are actually just compressed files containing a few control files and the data to be extracted on the filesystem. This article will walk you through the steps of creating these packages by hand.</p><a href="tutorials/Building_IPK_packages_by_hand.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="snippets/Where_is_dropbearconvert_on_ubuntu.html">Where is dropbearconvert on Ubuntu?</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">02-04-2019 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>Dropbear is a lightweight SSH server and client implementation, often used on embedded systems and routers. If you use the dropbear SSH client (dbclient) and want to use a private key, it needs to be in the dropbear format and cannot have a passphrase. Dropbear provides a conversion utility to convert openssh style keys to dropbear style keys, dropbearconvert, but on Ubuntu it's not in your $PATH. This means you have to provide the full path to execute it, which is cumbersome. There is a bug in Ubuntu that has been reported in 2012, but in Ubuntu 18.04 (2019) it's still not fixed.</p><a href="snippets/Where_is_dropbearconvert_on_ubuntu.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="software/Simple_pygopherd_log_analyzer.html">Simple pygopherd log analyzer</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">20-03-2019 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>Simple log analyzer for pygopherd.
