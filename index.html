           <h2>About</h2> <p>Hi there! I'm Remy, a Linux/UNIX sysadmin; my primary focus is on <b>building high-available cloud environments in OpenStack, Azure or on premise with Ansible and Terraform</b> (or any other configuration management tool). My keywords are OpenStack, cloud, virtualization, high-availability, scaling and clustering, security, (Open)SSL, Python, Powershell, Bash and general linux/UNIX system administration. Besides that I also develop software in <a href="https://github.com/raymiiorg/">Python</a>.</p><p>I currently work for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VolkerWessels">VolkerWessels</a>, the largest Dutch civil engineering construction company as an (Azure) cloud specialist. </p><p>I've worked as a sysadmin (in a devops role) for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_MC">the Erasmus University Medical Center</a> (a large hospital and medical university in Rotterdam), <a href="https://www.digidentity.eu/">Digidentity</a> (a Dutch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKIoverheid">certificate authority</a>, the company that develops <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiD">DigiD</a> and other Ruby on Rails applications), <a href="https://www.cloudvps.com/about-cloudvps"</a>CloudVPS</a> (an OpenStack cloud provider) and a few other smaller companies. I like to design, build, document and manage large, complex and high-available systems. I'm a team player that loves to work with configuration management tools and version control systems. If I do something more than three times, I automate it. <b>Planning, documentation, monitoring and backups are things I do first, not when the time allows it later.</b> Last but not least I have an interest in legacy systems like the PDP-11, PDP-8 and operating systems like OpenVMS, HP-UX and old UNIX systems.</p><p>To get in touch, <a href="https://raymii.org/s/static/About.html">click here</a>.<br><br>This is my personal website, please do note that these articles do not reflect or are based on work, opinions or policies of any of my (previous) employers. Any resemblance to reality is pure coincidence.</p><p>This site started in 2006 as my form of (public) documentation. It has grown to include software, tutorials, snippets and articles on linux/UNIX, system administration and everything related with over 10.000 unique visitors a day as of <a href="https://raymii.org/s/inc/img/hits-2018.png">2018-06</a>.

I like the simple interface, the speed and the ability to customize the workflow. Email is synced with offlineimap and sent via msmtp, addresses are in abook, and calcurse is the Calendar for meetings, no complicated setup there. One aspect I especially like is the ability to view attachments on the command line right from Mutt itself. Some departments at work send emails with an attached PDF or .docx file that contains the actual message, instead of just putting the text in the email itself. Using pandoc and pdftotext in Mutt, the text of the attachments is displayed as a regular mail, no interruptions in my workflow by opening an external program. This article explains how to set up your .muttrc and .mailcap to use pandoc and pdf2text to view attachments as text in mutt.</p><a href="articles/Viewing_PDF_docx_and_odt_files_in_Mutt.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="snippets/Get_json_value_with_sed.html">Get a JSON value with bash and sed</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">26-02-2019 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>Recently I was asked to get one value from a json object using only shell tools. The json in question is from a dutch radio station and it lists the current song that is played. Using this together with a few shell commands and notify-send we can show the current song when it changes as a desktop notification. I'd rather use Python or jq if it has to be shell. In this case the co-worker asked to just use simple shell tools and no external dependencies.</p><a href="snippets/Get_json_value_with_sed.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="blog/My_phone_serves_me_400_ads_per_hour_blokada_blocks_beats_them_all.html">My phone serves me 400+ ads and trackers per hour. Blokada, the best android adblocker, beats 'm all!</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">16-02-2019 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>Recently I switched to a new phone. After a few years (!) my old phone stopped receiving calls making it time for a new one. The new phone has Android, which allowed me to install a system wide adblocker, Blokada. It works by posing itself as a local VPN, filtering advertisements, trackers and all kinds of nasty things that spy on you or bring in malware. It does not require root access on Android, it's open source and best of all, it works very well. In the first three days of usage it has blocked over 5000 ads and trackers, including 400 when I was asleep.</p><a href="blog/My_phone_serves_me_400_ads_per_hour_blokada_blocks_beats_them_all.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Split_keyboards_a_five_year_review_including_the_ErgoDox_EZ_Matias_Ergo_Pro_and_Kinesis_Freestyle_2.html">Split keyboards, a five year review including the ErgoDox EZ, Matias Ergo Pro and Kinesis Freestyle 2</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">10-02-2019 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>A split keyboard is weird at first, but once you get used to it, you will never want anything else. The keyboard is made up from two halves allowing your arms and wrists to be in a natural (neutral, straight) position, instead of having an angle/twist in your wrist. I've been using split keyboards for about five years now. Over those years I've tried several different models from different manufacturers. In this article I'll talk about the three split keyboards I've used intensively and two I have only seen or tried shortly. We'll start with my current and favorite split keyboard, the ErgoDox EZ. The other two I've used are the Matias Ergo Pro and the Kinesis Freestyle 2. I discuss the UHK and Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 briefly.</p><a href="articles/Split_keyboards_a_five_year_review_including_the_ErgoDox_EZ_Matias_Ergo_Pro_and_Kinesis_Freestyle_2.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="software/Sparkling_Network.html">Sparkling Network</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">12-01-2019 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>This is an overview of all the servers in the Sparkling Network, mostly as an overview for myself, but it might be interesting for others.

In this post I'll try out both the client and server on a Windows 2019 server, including how to login as a Active Directory Domain user and how to generate and place and SSH keypair. The bonus this time is how to elevate permissions via SSH on Windows, sudo but way more complicated. This guide is also applicable on Windows 10, build 1809 and up.</p><a href="tutorials/SSH_on_Windows_Server_2019.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/OpenSSL_command_line_Root_and_Intermediate_CA_including_OCSP_CRL and_revocation.html">OpenSSL command line Root and Intermediate CA including OCSP, CRL and revocation</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">17-12-2018 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>These are quick and dirty notes on generating a certificate authority (CA), intermediate certificate authorities and end certificates using the OpenSSL command line tools. It includes OCSP, CRL and CA Issuer information and specific issue and expiry dates. We'll set up our own root CA. We'll use the root CA to generate an example intermediate CA. We'll use the intermediate CA to sign end user certificates.</p><a href="tutorials/OpenSSL_command_line_Root_and_Intermediate_CA_including_OCSP_CRL and_revocation.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/Ansible_-_Only_if_on_specific_distribution_or_distribution_version.html">Ansible - Only do action if on specific distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS or RHEL) or distribution version (ubuntu precise, ubuntu trusty)</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">16-12-2018 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>This ansible playbook example helps you execute actions only if you are on a certain distribution. You might have a mixed environment with CentOS and Debian, when using ansible to execute actions on different servers you don't need to run yum on debian, or apt on CentOS. Some package names are different and such, so this helps you with a when statement to select a specific distribution. As a bonus, you also get a when for specific distribution versions, like Ubuntu precise (12.04 LTS) or Ubuntu trusty (14.04 LTS).</p><a href="tutorials/Ansible_-_Only_if_on_specific_distribution_or_distribution_version.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/Ansible_-_Only-do-something-if-another-action-changed.html">Ansible - Only do something if another action changed</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">15-12-2018 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>This Ansible tutorial shows you how execute actions only if another action has changed. For example, a playbook which downloads a remote key for package signing but only executes the apt-add command if the key has changed. Or a playbook which clones a git repository and only restarts a service if the git repository has changed.</p><a href="tutorials/Ansible_-_Only-do-something-if-another-action-changed.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/Ansible_-_Add_an_apt-repository_on_Debian_and_Ubuntu.html">Ansible - Add an apt-repository on Debian and Ubuntu</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">14-12-2018 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>This is a guide that shows you how to add an apt repository to Debian and Ubuntu using Ansible. It includes both the old way, when the apt modules only worked on Ubuntu, and the new way, now that the apt-modules also support Debian, plus some other tricks.</p><a href="tutorials/Ansible_-_Add_an_apt-repository_on_Debian_and_Ubuntu.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/Line_total_up_down_sum_in_php_weathermap.html">Line total (up+down sum) in PHP Network Weathermap</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">13-11-2018 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>With PHP Network Weathermap you can create a birds-eye view of network components from your monitoring system (like LibreNMS, Cacti or anything else with an RRD database). It can display simple maps with components and links between, showing up and down traffic, but also complex systems with custom components, like Nagios status, temperature or other information. For network and system administrators seeing the seperate in and out traffic of a link is fine, we can sum up two numbers. A co worker filling the role of service manager asked me if it was possible to sum up in and out and show that, including the scale (different colours depending on link usage). This co worker is not interested in the seperate up/down link speed but wants to know how much traffic a location is using in total. Using a clever workaround, you can display a line's total usage, including the scale. This article also gives some more tips on weathermap, colouring and scale.</p><a href="tutorials/Line_total_up_down_sum_in_php_weathermap.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4><a href="tags/all.html" class="link">All Items</a></h4><div class="footer">
