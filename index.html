You might have a mixed environment with CentOS and Debian, when using ansible to execute actions on different servers you don't need to run yum on debian, or apt on CentOS. Some package names are different and such, so this helps you with a when statement to select a specific distribution. As a bonus, you also get a when for specific distribution versions, like Ubuntu precise (12.04 LTS) or Ubuntu trusty (14.04 LTS).</p><a href="tutorials/Ansible_-_Only_if_on_specific_distribution_or_distribution_version.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/Ansible_-_Only-do-something-if-another-action-changed.html">Ansible - Only do something if another action changed</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">15-12-2018 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>This Ansible tutorial shows you how execute actions only if another action has changed.

It can display simple maps with components and links between, showing up and down traffic, but also complex systems with custom components, like Nagios status, temperature or other information. For network and system administrators seeing the seperate in and out traffic of a link is fine, we can sum up two numbers. A co worker filling the role of service manager asked me if it was possible to sum up in and out and show that, including the scale (different colours depending on link usage). This co worker is not interested in the seperate up/down link speed but wants to know how much traffic a location is using in total. Using a clever workaround, you can display a line's total usage, including the scale.

As you might know, I'm a fan of their (mostly open source) hardware security devices. Their newsletters introduced two new keys, the Nitrokey Pro 2 and the Nitrokey FIDO-U2F key. On their website I also saw the Nitrokey Storage Pro 2. This article is a summary of the newsletters and goes over the new features in the new hardware. It boils down to a new OpenPGP smartcard version (3.3, it was 2.1) in the Nitrokey Pro 2 and Storage 2.

For all the Windows clients this went automatically due to domain policies, for Linux this has to be set up manually. Defining the proxy in /etc/environment was not enough since NTML authentication is required, which is not supported by default. I found cntlm, a piece of software which acts as a local proxy, translating all requests to authenticated NTLM requests to your upstream proxy. This guide covers the (offline) installation, setup, getting the correct password hash and system-wide configuration. It should work on a desktop as well, but I did not test that.</p><a href="tutorials/Use_Ubuntu_behind_a_Microsoft_ForeFront_TMG_proxy_with_cntlm.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/Encrypt_and_decrypt_files_to_public_keys_via_the_OpenSSL_Command_Line.html">Encrypt and decrypt files to public keys via the OpenSSL Command Line</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">25-10-2018 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>This small tutorial will show you how to use the openssl command line to encrypt and decrypt a file using a public key.

Setup and getting started is easy and it has enough advanced options and tunables. I recently discovered that LibreNMS is able to check services as well. Services, in this context, means, executing Nagios plugins (like check_http, check_ping, etc). This allows you to check services that SNMP does not cover by default, like HTTP(s) health checks, certificate expiry, tcp port checks (e.g. rdp) and anything for which you can write a Nagios plugin yourself. The performance data, if available, is graphed automatically. Alerting is done with the regular LibreNMS alerts. This guide covers the setup of services (it's not enabled by default) and a few basic checks, like an http health check, certificate expiry and SSH monitoring.</p><a href="tutorials/Service_checks_in_LibreNMS_nagios_plugins.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="snippets/tping_ping_with_a_timestamp.html">tping - ping with a timestamp</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">03-09-2018 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>tping is a bash alias I once got from an old co-worker.

This allows you to multiplex HTTPS and other SSL protocols on the same port, or as their blog states, 'to distinguish between SSL/TLS and other protocols when forwarding traffic using a TCP (stream) proxy'. This can be used to run SSH and HTTPS on the same port (or any other SSL protocol next to HTTPS). By running SSH and HTTPS on the same port, one can circumvent certain firewall restrictions. If the session looks like HTTPS, nginx will handle it, if it looks like something else, it will forward it to the configured other program. I used to use SSHL to get this functionality, but now it's built into the nginx webserver. This small guide will cover the installation of the latest version of nginx on Ubuntu (16.04) and configuring this multiplex feature.</p><a href="tutorials/nginx_1.15.2_ssl_preread_protocol_multiplex_https_and_ssh_on_the_same_port.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="blog/Site_Improvements_for_accessibility.html">Site updates for accessibility, text only pages and skip to main content</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">01-08-2018 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>I've made some new improvements to this website.

The screenshots were automated via AutoIt on a network share, the user manually logged in every evening to check the pictures. With bash and postfix/sendmail we can automate this process, the user now doesn't have to login but can just check their email. There are a lot of snippets and guides to attach emails via the shell, but displaying multiple images inline as an HTML mail was something I had to figure out. You cannot embed the image in base64 HTML because Outlook doesn't show that, you must use the Content-ID style embed. Like UUENCODE, but more complicated. (The next step in this process with the user is to automate the reason why they have to check those screenshots every night, that is something for another article)</p><a href="snippets/Send_email_with_multiple_inline_images_via_bash.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="software/log_vcs_-_Ansible_Callback_plugin_that_creates_git_branches_for_every_ansible_run.html">log_vcs - Ansible callback plugin that creates VCS (git) branches for every Ansible run</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">10-07-2018 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>This Ansible callback plugin creates a VCS branch every time you run Ansible. If you ever need to go back to a certain state or environment, check out that branch and be sure nothing has changed. This is useful when you have multiple environments or multiple people deploying and continually develop your Ansible. When you often deploy to test / acceptance and less often to production, you can checkout the last branch that deployed to production if a hotfix or other maintenance is required, without having to search back in your commits and logs. I would recommend to develop infrastructure features in feature branches and have the master branch always deployable to production. However, reality learns that that is not always the case and this is a nice automatic way to have a fallback.</p><a href="software/log_vcs_-_Ansible_Callback_plugin_that_creates_git_branches_for_every_ansible_run.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/Windows_7_Installer_on_KVM_Linux_VPS_Digital_Ocean.html">Windows 7 installer on a KVM Linux VPS (Windows on Digital Ocean)</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">01-07-2018 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>For fun I wanted to install Windows 7 on a KVM Linux VPS (on [Digital Ocean) but it should work for any KVM or XEN-HVM VPS with console access). I was experimenting with Grub2 and ISO booting, since grub2 can natively boot a linux ISO. For Windows this is not possible, the installer needs to be extracted on a FAT32 partition from which you boot. On a normal system I would repartition the disk using a live CD, but on a VPS where an ISO cannot be booted this is troublesome. If I could boot from an ISO I would use that to install Windows, but where's the fun in that? I had to figure out how to shrink an EXT4 filesystem from a running Ubuntu VPS, which is possible, however very risky, with pivot_root. Next the partiton table can be converted to MBR, the partition can be resized, a FAT32 partiton and filesystem can be created, the Windows Installer files copied onto that, some Grub config and a reboot later, you're in the Windows 7 Installer.</p><a href="tutorials/Windows_7_Installer_on_KVM_Linux_VPS_Digital_Ocean.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4><a href="tags/all.html" class="link">All Items</a></h4><div class="footer">
