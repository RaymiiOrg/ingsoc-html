    <h2>Hi there!</h2>   <p>I'm Remy, a developer with a focus on C, C++, linux and embedded systems.</p> <p>I currently work for <a href="http://www.dejongduke.nl/">De Jong DUKE</a> were I develop software for an embedded  platform that powers coffee machines. This is a C++, C and Qt stack running on Yocto linux and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_RTOS">Nucleus RTOS</a>. It controls hardware, runs the UI and has  a few utilities for IoT connectivity and configuration. Technology is mostly C++ but includes Microsoft Visual C++, Flash, Qt and ARM kernel drivers.</p> <p>I've been a Linux and UNIX sysadmin for over 10 years.</p> <p>To read more or get in touch, <a href="https://raymii.org/s/static/About.html"> click here</a>.</p>  <p>This is my personal website, these articles do not reflect or are based on work, opinions or policies of any of my (previous) employers.

I've updated the layout of the website to be less cluttered, allowing you to get to the content much faster. Inspired by my recent gopher adventures I decided to do away with the 2 column layout (drop the sidebar with menu) and have a smaller header with essential links. On mobile this makes a huge difference in scrolling, on the desktop it looks less cluttered. This article details all the changes with side by side images showing differences.</p><a href="blog/Site_updated_new_2019_layout.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="snippets/Bash_Bits_Find_all_files_containing_specific_text.html">Bash Bits: Find all files containing specific text (and remove them)</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">07-05-2019 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>Bash Bits are small examples, tips and tutorials for Bash (Scripts).

This script downloads an URL, parses it with readability and returns the plaintext (as markdown). It supports RSS feeds (will convert every article in the feed) and saves every article. My usecase is twofold. One is to convert RSS feeds to a gopher site, the second is to get full text in my RSS reader. The script contains a few workarounds for so-called cookiewalls. It also pauses between RSS feed articles to not do excessive requests. The readability part is handled by Python, no external services are used.</p><a href="software/totext.py-Convert_URL_or_RSS_feed_to_plaintext_with_readability.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Convert_markdown_inline_links_to_reference_style_links_with_Pandoc.html">Convert markdown inline links to reference style links with Pandoc</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">10-04-2019 | Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>Markdown has two options to create a link. A link is the piece of text you click to go to another webpage. Actually, three ways, since you can just embed HTML code in Markdown. I write all the content for this site in Markdown files, which are then converted by my static site generator to HTML, text and a gopher version. I'm used to using the inline link style, which is  where you paste the link right in the text. Since I've enabled the Gopher  version of raymii.org, I noticed that there was no line wrapping. The HTML  website all arranges that via CSS, but the text-only Gopher does not. Sometimes  Gopher clients wrap text, but most don't. I'm re-wrapping all articles to make them fit, but the wrapping is way off with inline style markdown links. By  converting them to reference style markdown links, the wrapping looks way better, and as an added bonus, reference style links give a better overview. There are a few scripts floating around to convert these links, but either  Ruby or NodeJS. It turns out after a bit of research that Pandoc, the anything-to-anything text conversion tool, has an option to use reference style links. With this option, I converted all the articles here (almost 400) to the reference style Markdown links.</p><a href="articles/Convert_markdown_inline_links_to_reference_style_links_with_Pandoc.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h4><a href="tags/all.html" class="link">View all Items</a></h4></div><br/><footer><br/>
